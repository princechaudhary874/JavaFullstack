/*2. The video game machines at your local arcade output coupons according to how well you play the game.
You can redeem 10 coupons for a candy bar or 3 coupons for a gumball. You prefer candy bars to
gumballs. Write a program that defines a variable ini∆üally assigned to the number of coupons you win.
Next, the program should output how many candy bars and gumballs you can get if you spend all of your
coupons on candy bars first, and any remaining coupons on gumballs.
